# tilemancer
Script for GIMP that adds a sprite sheet generation feature to `Filter/Animations/tilemancer`. If you use layer groups to organize different animations of the same sprite, you can generate one row per layer group. Alternatively, use a square shape to optimize file size.

Tilemancer sets the grid size for you when generating, just make sure that the grid is enabled if you want to use that.

## Installation
* Put it in your script folder. you can find the script folder by going to `Edit/Preferences/Folders/Scripts` in GIMP.
* Click on `Filters/Script-Fu/'Refresh Scrips'`
